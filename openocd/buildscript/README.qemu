To build this QEMU source package, you will need a Linux machine for building.
For building Win32 host QEMU, you will need a cross compiler targeted for Win32.
You can use mingw-w64 (3.2.0 or newer).

BuildToolChain in buildscript directory can be used to build QEMU and libraries
in this package. If you build it natively on Linux, run

  ./BuildToolChain qemu

If you build for Win32 host, run

  ./BuildToolChain -H i686-w64-mingw32 qemu
