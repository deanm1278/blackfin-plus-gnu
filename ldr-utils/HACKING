--------------
 Interactions
--------------

Users interact with ldr.c in order to create/view/load/whatever LDRs.  The
ldr.c file uses common functions in lfd.c to perform the requested steps.  The
common lfd.c code dives down into processor specific lfd_xxx.c files as needed.

When creating LDRs from ELF objects, lfd.c uses functions in ldr_elf.c.  As
needed, chunks of Blackfin opcodes are customized and inserted into the LDR
from the dxe headers.

All code uses the helper functions in helpers.c.

The headers.h creates a sane uniform environment for the rest of the code to
work.  This way the rest of the code base stays clean of painful ifdef's that
are needed only for portability.
