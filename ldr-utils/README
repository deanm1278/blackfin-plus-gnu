 ABOUT 
-------

ldr-utils is a simple command line program for handling LDR files.  LDR files 
are the executable format for the Blackfin on-chip Boot ROM.  We need to handle
this format for initial booting of the processor (so boot loaders or bare metal
applications).

To put it simply, LDRs are just a container format for DXEs (which are just a
fancy name for programs in the Blackfin binary object code format).  A single
LDR is made up of an arbitrary number of DXEs and a single DXE is made up of
an arbitrary number of blocks (each block contains starting address and some
flags).
